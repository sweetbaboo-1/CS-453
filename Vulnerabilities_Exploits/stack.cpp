 * 1. The attacker must provide more data into the outwardly facing buffer than the buffer is designed to hold.
 * 2. The attacker must know where the return address pointer resides on the stack. This should be just beyond the end of the buffer.
 * 3. The attacker must insert machine language instructions in the buffer. This may occur before, after, or even around the return address pointer. The machine language could be already compiled code in the program
 * 4. The attacker must overwrite the return address. The old value, directing the flow of the program after the function is returned, must be changed from the calling function to the provided machine language in step 3.
